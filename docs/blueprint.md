- Background color: Soft desaturated teal (#B0E2E2), a lighter tint of the primary color, to keep focus on imagery.
- Accent color: Warm orange (#FF8C00), analogous to teal, for call-to-action buttons and highlights.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headings and titles, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text. The former is elegant, while the latter is modern.
- Use custom icons inspired by dragon scales, Viking symbols, and other thematic elements.
- Use a grid-based layout with plenty of white space to ensure a clean and modern design.  Feature high-quality images prominently.
- Subtle animations when scrolling through images, for a magical effect.
